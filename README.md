A simple blog application written in Go.

## A note on styling
- utilizing Tailwind from CDN whilst in development; at deploy, we will want to include and minify and such


## Wishlist
- [ ] Come up with color palette and apply it across
    - [ ] start with dark mode but also enable light or dark
- [ ] Add tags and filtering for blogs page
- [ ] Tooling to edit and add posts quickly
    - [ ] bonus to add the image generator to add an image
- [ ] Where and how to deploy
- [ ] Goldmark has a footnote extension. Should we add that?
